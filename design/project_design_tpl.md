## Introduction

This report outlines the design and low-level implementation of a Smart Home Control System, which monitors temperature and light intensity through analog sensors and controls a fan driven by a DC motor. The system dynamically adjusts fan speed and direction based on sensor readings and user input. Configuration settings, including fan speed and rotation direction, are accessible and adjustable via keypad input. The design is implemented using native C programming, avoiding Arduino-based code or pre-developed libraries to ensure a customized, lightweight, and efficient solution.

### Purpose
The purpose of this specification is to outline the internal structure, functional components, and embedded constraints for implementing the Smart Home Control System, forming the basis for coding and module testing.

### Scope
The scope of this document includes:

- Design and implementation of the Smart Home system.
- Integration of analog sensors, Temperature sensor and LDR, and display of their values on an LCD screen.
- User-configurable settings via keypad input.
- Alert mechanism to notify the user when sensor readings exceed the defined limits.

This document serves as the reference for both coding and module testing, ensuring that the system works within the defined constraints and meets the project requirements.

The module priority is classified as P2, indicating that it is a necessary part of the system but not critical for initial deployment.

### Assumptions & Constraints

1. This system assumes stable input from sensors, using averaging to reduce noise.
2. The LCD display has limited character space, requiring concise data representation.
3. The module operates within the 8-bit MCU memory constraints and processing capacity.

## Functional Description
The ADC LCD Interface reads analog values from sensors connected to specified ADC channels. Data is sampled (for noise reduction) and displayed on an LCD. Threshold limits for sensor readings can be adjusted using a keypad, and UART communication sends real-time data to an external monitor.

## Implementation of the Module
This chapter discusses the detailed design of the Smart Home Control System, which consists of two main parts.

Temperature Control System (Fan Simulation):

- Temperature Sensor: This part of the system uses an ADC to read the temperature values from a sensor. The temperature is then displayed on the LCD. The fan speed 
  and direction can be controlled based on the temperature readings.
- Fan Speed and Direction Control: The fan simulates an air conditioning system. The fan's speed and direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) are adjusted based on 
  the temperature sensor's reading. The user can set threshold limits (Low Limit and High Limit) via the keypad, and these values determine when the fan will operate at different speeds or directions.

Smart Lighting System (LDR Sensor and LED):

- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) Sensor: This sensor is used to monitor the surrounding light intensity. The LDR sensor is connected to the ADC, and its readings 
  are displayed on the LCD.
- LED Control: The LED simulates the smart lighting system, and its brightness is adjusted based on the light intensity measured by the LDR. The LED's brightness can 
  be controlled to match desired lighting levels based on the sensor's readings.
